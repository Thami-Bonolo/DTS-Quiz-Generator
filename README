JAVA CLASSES
************
Main.java : Driver program

AVL.java
BinarySearchTree.java
HashTable.java
MaxHeap.java & MinHeap.java
RedBlackTree.java 
These are all data structures classes that are used in this program.
There wasn't any major modification done to them. Just the original code as 
you know it. Well a few changes were made to suit our program. :)

Randomize.java : Creates random integers and store in an array. And this is 
                used as our data to test/generate quizzes

Questions.java : generates the quizzes
                This class connnects the main file to the data structures.
                Takes in user input from main class and pass it to the desired DST then
                generates quizzes.

HOW TO RUN THE PROGRAM
**********************
We suggest that you start with "make clean" to remove all the unwanted(or should we say no longer needed files?) .txt files.
and re-compile the program.
This is done to keep the directory clean. Because each different quizzes create their own .txt file.

In the makefile, we have included the "run" rule. And its dependency is classes. 
So by default even if you run without compile it will do so automatically.
